# obfuscated-Class
Ok, its confused, but this don't is a obfuscated class algortimican, this a random **letter generator**, you can use this to 100%, but don't is an algorithm, its random letter generator.

## Editing code!.
The const '**abc**' contain the chars for the word generated, if you modified the const '**abc**' you can generate other word, the code is basic, i´m sorry for this, i know i´re redundant, but **the word generate is a random letter combination**, don't is an **algorithm**.

### Thanks for reading :D!.
